# TE Test Equipment Inventory — Import Profile

**Status:** Live aggregate profile available; source corrections and cutover rehearsal remain blocking

## Evidence boundary

The locally supplied `data/import/TE_Lab_Equipment_Export.xlsx` was read only for aggregate profiling and importer dry-run verification. The workbook is gitignored and must never be committed. This document records no row contents, identifier values, or source-file hash.

Visible workbook sheets:

| Sheet | Data rows | Import treatment |
|-------|----------:|------------------|
| `Inventory` | 573 | Selected as the inventory source. |
| `Import Issues` | 313 | Supporting sheet excluded by sheet selection. |
| `Export Summary` | 20 | Supporting sheet excluded by sheet selection. |

Supporting-sheet rows are not inventory rows and are not counted as ignored rows. The importer selects the single visible usable sheet named `Inventory`, case-insensitively, while preserving its actual sheet name in batch identity and provenance.

## Live aggregate observations

The selected `Inventory` sheet contains 573 rows. Aggregate calibration and verification observations are:

- calibration status: 211 `calibrated`, 314 `reference_only`, and 48 `unknown`;
- 209 nonblank last-calibration dates;
- 140 nonblank calibration due dates;
- 414 nonblank calibration vendors; and
- 115 true timeless verification flags.

Aggregate identity observations are:

- 145 blank asset numbers;
- 134 blank serial numbers;
- 41 rows blank in both asset and serial identity;
- four duplicate normalized asset keys across eight rows; and
- twelve duplicate normalized serial keys across 48 rows.

No row values or identifier keys are recorded here. Duplicate identity participation overlaps, so key-participation counts must not be added to infer the number of conflicted rows.

## Exact 22-column treatment

Header matching is case-insensitive, trims surrounding whitespace, and normalizes spaces/punctuation to underscores. Original headers and raw cell values remain available in the dry-run report. Every live column is classified below.

| Live header | Normalized target | Treatment |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| `Asset Number` | `asset_number` | Mapped |
| `Serial Number` | `serial_number` | Mapped |
| `Manufacturer` | `manufacturer` | Mapped |
| `Model` | `model` | Mapped |
| `Description` | `description` | Mapped |
| `Location` | `location` | Mapped |
| `Assigned To` | `assigned_to` | Mapped |
| `Lifecycle` | `lifecycle_status` | Mapped |
| `Working` | `working_status` | Mapped |
| `Condition` | `condition` | Mapped |
| `Cal Status` | `calibration_status` | Mapped |
| `Last Cal Date` | `last_calibrated_at` | Mapped |
| `Cal Due Date` | `calibration_due_at` | Mapped |
| `Cal Vendor` | `calibration_vendor` | Mapped |
| `Cal Cost` | — | Intentionally ignored; calibration cost is deferred. |
| `Ownership` | — | Intentionally ignored; ownership/rental detail is deferred. |
| `Rental Vendor` | — | Intentionally ignored; ownership/rental detail is deferred. |
| `Rental Cost/Mo` | — | Intentionally ignored; ownership/rental detail is deferred. |
| `Verified` | `verified` | Mapped. A valid true flag without `verifiedAt` leaves `verified_at` empty and reports `Timeless verified flag ignored; re-verification required`. |
| `Blue Dot` | — | Intentionally ignored; the legacy marker is deferred. |
| `Est. Age (Yrs)` | — | Intentionally ignored; estimated age is deferred. |
| `Notes` | `notes` | Mapped |

The importer also recognizes the normalized live aliases `cal_due_date` and `cal_vendor`. Deferred age ignores are deliberately limited to `est_age_yrs`, `est_age_years`, `estimated_age_years`, `age`, and `age_years`. Genuinely unknown columns with nonblank values remain row-rejecting.

## Calibration and verification semantics

| Legacy value or combination | `calibrationRequirement` | `outToCalibration` | Required handling |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| `calibrated` | `required` | `false` | Preserve explicit last/due dates. A missing due date remains valid input and derives `missing_due`, never `current`. |
| `out_to_cal` | `required` | `true` | Derived health is `out_to_cal` according to accepted precedence. |
| `reference_only` | `reference_only` | `false` | User-facing label is **Reference only**; derived health is `not_applicable`. |
| Explicit `not_required` | `not_required` | `false` | User-facing label is **Not required**; derived health is `not_applicable`. |
| `unknown`, blank, or missing status | `unknown` | `false` | Do not infer `required` from dates alone. |
| Separate requirement plus out-to-cal flag | Mapped requirement | Parsed flag | Keep the concepts separate; contradictory values reject the row. |

An explicit calibration due date remains authoritative. An interval may suggest a due date but cannot overwrite an imported explicit value. Current-state fields may be seeded, but the importer does not manufacture prior `CalibrationEvent` records.

A supplied valid `verifiedAt` must be RFC 3339. Invalid verification booleans and invalid supplied timestamps remain rejecting. A true timeless flag is non-blocking but does not invent a historical timestamp; it produces the exact re-verification issue shown in the mapping table.

## Verified live dry run

The mapping version is `te-test-equipment-v2`. Against a temporary empty FeOxDB, the selected `Inventory` sheet produced:

| Total | Inserted | Matched | Conflicted | Rejected | Ignored | Blocking |
|------:|---------:|--------:|-----------:|---------:|--------:|:--------:|
| 573 | 515 | 0 | 50 | 8 | 0 | `true` |

The reconciliation equation holds:

```text
573 = 515 + 0 + 50 + 8 + 0
```

The 50 identity-conflicted rows and eight invalid-date rows must be corrected in the source and dry-run again before any live commit. The all-or-nothing commit gate remains unchanged: conflicts or rejections block the batch; matched and intentionally ignored rows are durable no-ops.

## Importer and synthetic verification boundary

The v0.1 importer accepts local `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.xls` paths. CSV and generated XLSX fixtures exercise parsing and mapping. The `.xls` path is routed through calamine and invalid binary input produces an explicit error, but a valid binary `.xls` fixture has not been generated.

Synthetic fixtures cover case-insensitive `Inventory` sheet preference, ambiguity without an `Inventory` sheet, the exact 22 live headers, spaced and snake-case calibration aliases, due/vendor preservation, calibrated-without-due behavior, valid timeless verification diagnostics, invalid verification inputs, unknown nonblank columns, duplicate identities, all five row classifications, commit provenance, idempotency, and durable matched/no-op behavior. Synthetic fixtures contain no live lab inventory data.

Batch identity is derived from source content, selected sheet, and mapping version. Commit requires explicit confirmation, re-parses the source, revalidates source and reconciliation state, and writes inserts through normal FeOxDB mutation/outbox paths.

## Release and operations boundary

Aggregate profile completion is not cutover completion. Do not commit the workbook, enable production shared sync, publish, install on lab PCs, delete lab data, or retire the Python workflow. Before cutover, protect the corrected source, repeat the dry run, rehearse import and restore, prove backup retention and rollback, and retain the documented Python read-only window. Sync artifacts are not a backup.
