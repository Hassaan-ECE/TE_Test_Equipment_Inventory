# Release Evidence Checklist

Last updated: 2026-05-11

Archived note: this file is historical release evidence. Use `README.md` for current release state and `docs/engineering/AGENT_RUNBOOK.md` before release work.

## Status Legend

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked or needs decision

## Current 1.0.4 Release Blockers

- [x] Bump source version to `1.0.4` in `package.json`, `backend\Cargo.toml`, and `backend\tauri.conf.json`.
- [x] Keep source fallback shared root pointed at `S:\Engineering\Public\Syed_Hassaan_Shah\InventoryApps\ME`.
- [x] Build release binary and produce `1.0.4` NSIS installer.
- [x] Sign or verify the produced `1.0.4` installer/updater artifact with the Tauri updater key.
- [x] Stage `1.0.4` assets locally under `release\v1.0.4\`.
- [x] Stage the current installer at `S:\Engineering\Public\Syed_Hassaan_Shah\InventoryApps\ME\ME Inventory_1.0.4_x64-setup.exe`.
- [x] Move support files on the shared drive into `S:\Engineering\Public\Syed_Hassaan_Shah\InventoryApps\ME\release-support\v1.0.4\` so the ME root has only the installer `.exe` plus folders.
- [x] Upload `1.0.4` assets to GitHub Release `v1.0.4` and verify `releases/latest/download/latest.json`.
- [ ] Validate installed `1.0.3` updates to signed `1.0.4`.
- [ ] Run packaged `1.0.4` NSIS install smoke.
- [ ] Run real shared-drive multi-machine sync smoke.
- [ ] Confirm packaged CSP, image preview/open behavior, and signed updater behavior.
- [x] Confirm shared sync data lives under `S:\Engineering\Public\Syed_Hassaan_Shah\InventoryApps\ME\shared\inventory\`.
- [x] Archive the old Manufacturing shared root so stale clients fail visibly instead of syncing old data.
- [ ] Record tester, machine names, installer path, updater artifact path, GitHub release URL, SHA-256, commit, source version, result, and date.

## Current 1.0.4 Evidence

| Old Manufacturing shared root archived | 2026-05-11 | Codex | Build machine | `S:\Manufacturing\Internal\_Syed_H_Shah\InventoryApps\ME_ARCHIVED_DO_NOT_USE_20260511-142114\` |  | Pass | Original `S:\Manufacturing\Internal\_Syed_H_Shah\InventoryApps\ME\` path no longer exists, so stale clients pinned to that old sync root fail visibly instead of syncing old data. |

## Previous 1.0.3 Evidence

| Check | Date | Tester | Machine(s) | Artifact / URL | SHA-256 | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Previous 1.0.2 Evidence

| Check | Date | Tester | Machine(s) | Artifact / URL | SHA-256 | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1.0.2` release validation | 2026-05-02 | Codex | Build machine | Source tree |  | Pass | Passed `node scripts\run-bun.mjs audit`, frontend lint/test/build, backend `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo check`, and `cargo test`. `cargo clippy` and `cargo audit` are still unavailable locally. |
| `1.0.2` signed local/shared staging | 2026-05-02 | Codex | Build machine | `release\v1.0.2\`; `S:\Manufacturing\Internal\_Syed_H_Shah\InventoryApps\ME\releases\1.0.2\ME Inventory_1.0.2_x64-setup.exe` | `54737d2589d679324c38dc90557b3daa061641bd5b96e4e60f0675b756bb957c` | Pass | First Tauri NSIS bundle attempt hit Windows error 1224 after compiling the release executable; deleting only the generated `1.0.2` installer and rerunning produced the installer and `.sig`. `latest.json` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` are staged locally and on the shared drive. |
| `1.0.2` GitHub Release asset upload | 2026-05-02 | Codex | GitHub | `https://github.com/Hassaan-ECE/ME_Inventory_App_Tauri_v2/releases/tag/v1.0.2` | `54737d2589d679324c38dc90557b3daa061641bd5b96e4e60f0675b756bb957c` | Pass | Uploaded `latest.json`, installer, `.sig`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`; `releases/latest/download/latest.json` resolves to `1.0.2`, and the installer URL returns HTTP 200. GitHub normalized the installer asset name to `ME.Inventory_1.0.2_x64-setup.exe`, so `latest.json` uses that URL. |

## Previous 1.0.1 Evidence

| Check | Date | Tester | Machine(s) | Artifact / URL | SHA-256 | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Notes

- `1.0.3` still needs installed updater smoke from `1.0.2` after GitHub Release asset upload.
- Real two-machine smoke still needs to validate snapshot bootstrap, operation compaction, fast convergence, and field-level merge on the S-drive.
